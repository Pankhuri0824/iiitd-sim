# Vitual Map IIIT Delhi
This is a rudimentary virtual map of IIIT Delhi implemented with the help of Unity , a cross-platform game engine . The goal is to make a fully functional system that allows visitors to navigate the campus easily. This is just the virtual map section of the system. A functioning system can be found at : https://github.com/kshitijg2903/kshitijg2903-vns-system . This project is still in its early stages. 

Deployment of the interactive system can be found on this webpage temporary : https://iiitdsimulation.itch.io/vns 

### How to traverse : 
- W and S for front and back movements
- A and D for left and right movements
- Q and E for rotating the perspective 


### How to enter buildings : 
- For selected buildings there exists an option to go to a certain floor
- To enter a floor, locate a door like structure ( there will be a sign to enter with it)
- Keep moving forward until you come in contact with that sign and viola !
- You can exit the floor similarly


##### To be noted : 
- the github pages deployment does not work because of large file sizes
- previous versions of the project can be found here : https://github.com/Pankhuri0824/Virtual-IIIT-Delhi
